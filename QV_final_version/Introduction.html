    Welcome to this experiment!
</p>
<p>
    The following experiment is carried out as part of a seminar paper at Heidelberg University.
    Your personal data will be anonymized and not passed on.
</p>

<p>
    You are about to contribute to the comparison of two voting mechanisms by voting on a number of policy proposals:
    <p>
    <b>1. Majority Voting:</b>
        <p>
    Everybody gets one vote per election, the majority of people decides.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2. Quadratic Voting:</b>
        <p>
            Multiple votes can be cast for one issue. If a proposal receives more votes for then against, it will be implemented, regardless of the number of people who actually voted for/against it.
        </p>
