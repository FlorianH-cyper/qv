<p>
    You will now vote on those of the policy proposals that you just supported or disagreed with. You can now allocate multiple votes for the same issue under the Quadratic Voting mechanism
</p>
<p>
    <b>Important: You buy these votes with "vote-credits" (§). The cost in vote-credits  for voting on an issue is the square of the number of votes you want to cast on that issue.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Example: If you want to vote 3 times for/against the minimum wage, you spend 9 credits on that issue.
</p>


<p>
    cost overview:
<script>
table, th, td {
  border: 0.3px solid black;
}
th, td {
  text-align: center;
}
</script>
<table width="200px">
<tr><th>votes</th><th>cost</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1 §</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>4 §</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>9 §</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>16 §</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>25 §</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td><td>36 §</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td>49 §</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>64 §</td></tr>
    <tr><td>9</td><td>81 §</td></tr>
    <tr><td>10</td><td>100 §</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
    Try to spend the credits on votes according to which issues are important to you!
    You can also choose to spend nothing on an issue, but you should still submit the vote.
